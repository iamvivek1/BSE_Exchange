# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to optimize the BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) backend data fetching to provide faster, more efficient real-time stock data delivery to the frontend trading application. The current implementation fetches individual stock quotes one at a time, which creates latency and limits the real-time trading experience. This optimization will implement batch processing, caching, WebSocket connections, and data compression to significantly improve data fetch speeds and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to receive real-time stock price updates with minimal latency, so that I can make timely trading decisions based on current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL fetch and display initial stock data within 2 seconds
2. WHEN stock prices change THEN the system SHALL update the frontend within 500ms of the backend receiving new data
3. WHEN multiple stocks are being monitored THEN the system SHALL update all visible stock prices simultaneously
4. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL maintain data updates with graceful degradation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to monitor multiple stocks simultaneously without performance degradation, so that I can track my portfolio and potential investments efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring up to 50 stocks THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second update frequencies
2. WHEN adding new stocks to watchlist THEN the system SHALL include them in real-time updates without affecting existing performance
3. WHEN switching between different stock views THEN the system SHALL display cached data immediately while fetching fresh updates
4. IF a stock data request fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically without blocking other stock updates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to efficiently manage BSE API calls and data processing, so that we minimize API costs and maximize system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching stock data THEN the system SHALL batch multiple stock requests into single API calls where possible
2. WHEN stock data is requested THEN the system SHALL serve cached data if it's less than 5 seconds old
3. WHEN the BSE API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL serve the most recent cached data with appropriate staleness indicators
4. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL prioritize active user sessions and frequently requested stocks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want real-time bidirectional communication for order updates and market data, so that I can receive instant notifications about my trades and market changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I place an order THEN the system SHALL provide immediate confirmation via WebSocket connection
2. WHEN my order status changes THEN the system SHALL push updates to my client in real-time
3. WHEN significant market movements occur THEN the system SHALL broadcast alerts to relevant connected clients
4. WHEN my connection drops THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and sync any missed updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring for the data fetching system, so that I can quickly identify and resolve performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with timestamps and context
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL emit metrics for response times, cache hit rates, and connection counts
3. WHEN data inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and attempt automatic recovery
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure mechanisms to maintain stability
